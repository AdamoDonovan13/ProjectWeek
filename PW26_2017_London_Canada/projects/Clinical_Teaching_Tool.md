<!-- Objective bullet points -->
* To create a slicelet that will present to the user a series of images with an associated questionnaire.
* An administrator will be able to dynamically customize the questionnaire to suit the teaching application.
* User responses to the questionnaire will be captured for analysis.
|
<!-- Approach and Plan bullet points -->
* Create a slicelet to load questionnaire from xml file.
* Display images in a controlled fashion allowing for 'next' and 'back' button options.
* Capture questionnaire responses in xml format once user presses 'save'.
* Expand my knowledge of: 
** slicer classes and properties
** python coding and debugging
** connections between modules, xml and python code
