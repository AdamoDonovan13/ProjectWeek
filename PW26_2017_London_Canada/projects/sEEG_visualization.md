<!-- Objective bullet points -->
* Visualize sEEG in Slicer
|
<!-- Approach and Challenges bullet points -->
* Interpret output in Slicer (EDF format)
* Determine best way to visualize in Slicer
|
<!-- Progress and Next steps bullet points (fill out at the end of project week) -->
* Using Sequences module to record changes to slicer scene and then play back
* Module created to modify pre-made fiducial list based on corresponding sEEG values
** Attempted to visualize by translating the fiducials based, but that was  difficult to compresent
** Attempted to visualize by changing size and color of individual fiducials, but playback was very slow
** Finally used Glyphs and a color map to create 3d spheres with a colormap
