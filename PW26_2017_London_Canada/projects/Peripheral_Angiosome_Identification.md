<!-- Objective bullet points -->
* Identify angiosomes (regions of blood supply) in lower legs in MR image sets
|
<!-- Approach and Plan bullet points -->
* Create a template angiosome map, based on known anatomy
* Create a means to register and scale the template to match a new patient MR image set
* Using VMTK, identify arteries and centrelines, then map the connections between arteries and angiosomes
|
<!-- Progress and Next steps bullet points (fill out at the end of project week) -->
* Began developing a scripted module 
* Tested a number of methods for identifying and displaying arteries, and began integrating these into the scripted module
* Developed a procedure to register a template image set to a patient image set, and began integrating it into the scripted module
* Started a CorrectFieldBias module to improve artery segmentation
