<!-- Objective bullet points -->
* My project aim is to use Slicer for automated Segmentation of the human skull, face and airways from MRI dicom images.
|
<!-- Approach and Challenges bullet points -->
* I used various features of the Segment Editor for the following anatomy.
* For the airways, used Grow from Seeds which was a fast grow cut algorithm.
* For the skull, used Swiss Skull Stripper to extract the brain, followed by Thresholding and manual erasing.
* For the face, used thresholding.
|
<!-- Progress and Next steps bullet points (fill out at the end of project week) -->
* For the the very thin portions of the skull, I will try utilizing Michael Hardisty's deblurring algorithm [1]
